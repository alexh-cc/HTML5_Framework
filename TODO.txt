- update to pixi v4
	- https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/tree/dev

- spine sprites - multiple atlas support

- spine sprite - finish it - some methods are empty

- could have an easier way of just specifying classes for core components, if they were stored in a keyed object.
    - this would prevent having to override entire function in order to use custom sound, stage, etc

- add bitmapdata and bitmap classes like phaser

- make system os version future proof for ios

- UML map

- remove version hand coding from Game template

- make the name spaces and folder structure match

- restore any relevant pixi mods
	- Text numlines

- make a better way to link screens to manifests - through game config json
	 >> see DarkAscent for an example of this

- loaders
	- don't use callback objects

- grunt stuff -----------------------

- have a separate release log from changelog - could be manual

- jshint - a lot of work

- get gameId from package json - only works if compiling the code
- this is a game template task
- assign game id to html title

- yuidoc?
